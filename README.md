The leading cause of death and severe injuries in the world is the Road Accident. In India, the rate of occurrence of an accident is more than a critical limit. In 2018 alone, the country reported around 151 thousand fatalities due to road accident. It may not be stopped altogether, but can be reduced. A World Bank study has found that if India were to halve road deaths and injuries between 2014 and 2038 successfully, it could potentially add 14 per cent to its GDP per capita. This paper deals with the visualization of Road Accident data to identify the trends that are causing all the possible accident. Visualization will help to find the hidden pattern in the data to find the standard features between accident.
